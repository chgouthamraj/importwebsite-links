- [vs code automatic snippet generator](https://snippet-generator.app/?description=console+log&tabtrigger=cls&snippet=console.log%28%27%3E%3E%241%3C%3C%27%29&mode=vscode)
```
$1 first position where tab appears
$2 second position where tab appears
${1:lable} used to describe label

sample code:-

  Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  same ids are connected.
  Example:
  "Print to console": {
  	"prefix": "log",
  	"body": [
  		"console.log('$1');",
  		"$2"
  	],
  	"description": "Log output to console"
  }
